# 🛡️ SafeHood - Community Safety & GBV Response App

**SafeHood** is an AI-augmented, community-driven mobile platform designed to **prevent, report, and respond** to incidents of crime, with a special focus on **gender-based violence (GBV)** in underserved townships and urban areas. This project uses a **scalable, production-ready tech stack** to support real-time safety alerts, live responder dispatch, secure data storage, and offline-first access to emergency services.

## 📱 Mobile Use Case: Protecting Women & Children First

In many townships, vulnerable individuals—especially women and children—face threats that go **unreported** due to fear, inaccessibility, or lack of responsive systems. SafeHood offers a **silent SOS trigger**, **geo-tagged alerting**, and **instant community response**, serving as a **digital shield** when human intervention fails.

## 💡 Pitch Narrative

Imagine a mother walking home at dusk in Soweto. Three taps on her phone’s power button quietly alerts her loved ones, nearby SafeHood responders, and even dispatches community volunteers. Her phone records a voice note. Her location is live-tracked. A digital eye watches—and acts. **SafeHood is not just an app. It’s a shield. A system. A statement.**
